Genesis Resurgence Collection - XO
The Genesis Resurgence Collection is an NFT collection featuring unique artworks and gameplay. Each NFT in the collection features a different artwork and set of attributes, with a limited total supply. The game, developed by the community, will involve strategic thinking and problem-solving to complete a series of missions. Players will have the opportunity to win unique prizes, such as rare NFTs and other rewards.

This project is built on the Elrond blockchain, with the initial minting and distribution of NFTs being done through NFTOny's test environment. This README file serves as a guide for developers and contributors, providing information on the project's goals, how to contribute to the development of the game and NFT collection, and the unique features of the Elrond blockchain and NFTOny's test environment that make them well-suited for this project.
