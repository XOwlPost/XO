## Other Dependencies

Our project leverages a variety of tools and libraries to enhance development efficiency and performance. Understanding and setting up these dependencies is key to contributing effectively to the project.

### Trunk.io for CI/CD Pipelines:

1. **Purpose**: We use Trunk.io as our primary tool for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). It automates the process of testing and deploying code changes, ensuring a smooth and reliable development workflow.

2. **Setup**: 
   - Ensure you have access to our Trunk.io setup.
   - Familiarize yourself with our CI/CD pipeline configurations and how they integrate with our code repositories and deployment processes.

3. **Usage**:
   - Follow our project's guidelines for committing code and initiating build processes.
   - Monitor your build status and address any integration issues that arise in Trunk.io's dashboard or interface.

### Rust for Smart Contract Development:

1. **Why Rust**:
   - We've chosen Rust for developing smart contracts, particularly for the Elrond platform, due to its performance efficiency, memory safety, and reliability â€“ crucial factors in blockchain development.

2. **Installation**:
   - Install Rust by following the instructions on the [official Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
   - Familiarize yourself with Rust tooling, including `cargo`, Rust's package manager and build system.

3. **Learning Resources**:
   - If you're new to Rust, explore its [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and online resources to get up to speed with its syntax and features.

### Other Scripting and Coding Tools:

- **Scripting Languages**: Depending on the specific requirements of different submodules, we might use other scripting or programming languages. Keep an eye on each submodule's documentation for any such dependencies.
- **Performance-Centric Tools**: For parts of the project where performance is critical, we may employ specific libraries or frameworks. Familiarize yourself with these as they are introduced to the project.

### Conclusion:

Apart from the core technologies like Docker, Git, and the primary programming languages, our project relies on specific tools like Trunk.io for CI/CD and Rust for smart contract development to maintain high standards of efficiency and quality. Understanding and effectively using these tools is crucial for contributing to the project. As we progress, we might introduce additional tools and libraries to enhance our capabilities, so staying adaptable and continuously learning is key.
