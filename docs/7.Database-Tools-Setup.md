Certainly! Given that your project utilizes both PostgreSQL for the LikesTokenV2 submodule and a simplified Google database solution for the TicTacToe submodule, it's essential to include instructions for setting up these database tools. Here's a tailored guide for the "Database Tools" section of your documentation:

## Database Tools Setup

Our project leverages different types of databases for various submodules, each requiring specific setup and tools. For the LikesTokenV2 submodule, we use PostgreSQL, while the TicTacToe submodule utilizes a Google database solution.

### PostgreSQL Setup for LikesTokenV2:

1. **Installing PostgreSQL**:
   - Download and install PostgreSQL from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
   - Choose the version and installation instructions appropriate for your operating system.

2. **Setting Up Locally**:
   - After installation, set up your local PostgreSQL server.
   - Create a new database for the LikesTokenV2 submodule.
   - Configure the required tables and relationships as per the submodule's database schema.

3. **Containerized PostgreSQL**:
   - If you prefer to run PostgreSQL inside a Docker container, you can use the official PostgreSQL Docker image.
   - In your `docker-compose.yml`, define a service for PostgreSQL with appropriate configurations (ports, volumes, environment variables for credentials, etc.).

### Google Database Solution for TicTacToe:

1. **Google Database Integration**:
   - For the TicTacToe submodule, we use a specific Google database solution, which might refer to one of Google's database offerings like Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, or Google Cloud SQL.
   - Determine the exact Google database service used and refer to its specific setup and integration documentation.

2. **API and SDK Setup**:
   - Ensure that the necessary APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.
   - Install the relevant Google SDKs or client libraries in the TicTacToe submodule to interact with the database.

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up environment variables or configuration files with necessary credentials and database connection details.
   - Remember to add sensitive information like API keys or connection strings to your `.gitignore` file to keep them secure.

### Conclusion

Proper setup and configuration of database tools are critical for the functionality of our submodules. PostgreSQL offers robust database capabilities for LikesTokenV2, while the Google Firestore database solution provides a simplified and scalable database option for TicTacToe. Ensure you follow the specific setup instructions for each database system and reach out to the team if you encounter any issues or need assistance with database configurations.

This customized section addresses the specific database requirements of our submodules, providing guidance on both traditional SQL databases (PostgreSQL) and cloud-based solutions (Google's database services Firestore). It ensures that team members are aware of the necessary tools and setup procedures for each database system used in the project.

Given our specific use case where Firestore's real-time update and scalability features are crucial for the TicTacToe module, and PostgreSQL's capabilities are needed for other modules that require complex queries and advanced analysis, maintaining both databases is a strategic decision.

## Database Tools Strategy

Our project employs a dual-database approach, utilizing both Firestore and PostgreSQL, each catering to distinct requirements of our different submodules.

### Firestore for TicTacToe:

- **Real-Time Updates**: Firestore excels in providing real-time updates, which is essential for the interactive nature of the TicTacToe module.
- **Scalability**: It offers high scalability, which can support the dynamic nature and potential growth of the TicTacToe submodule.
- **Ease of Use**: Firestore's seamless integration with other Google Cloud services and its straightforward SDKs make it an efficient choice for real-time applications.

### PostgreSQL for Advanced Data Handling:

- **Complex Queries**: PostgreSQL is used in other modules where there is a need for handling complex queries and relational data.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Its robust features support advanced data analysis, which is crucial for modules that require deep data insights and interrelations.
- **Reliability and Flexibility**: PostgreSQL is known for its reliability, data integrity, and flexibility in managing diverse data workloads.

### Integrating Firestore and PostgreSQL:

- **Complementary Strengths**: By employing both Firestore and PostgreSQL, we leverage the strengths of each: real-time operations and scalability from Firestore, and complex data handling and analysis from PostgreSQL.
- **Data Synchronization**: If needed, we can implement synchronization mechanisms or use middleware to facilitate communication between these databases, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

### Conclusion:

The choice to use both Firestore and PostgreSQL is driven by the specific needs of our submodules. Firestore provides the real-time, scalable database solution ideal for the TicTacToe module, while PostgreSQL caters to the complex query and analysis requirements of other modules. This dual-database strategy ensures that each submodule operates optimally with the best-suited database solution, aligning with our project's diverse requirements and goals.
