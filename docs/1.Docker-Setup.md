That's a great start. Walking your team through the Docker setup is crucial, especially for those who might be new to Docker. Here's how you can structure this part of the documentation:

## Docker Setup

### What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containerization allows you to package your application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, ensuring that it works seamlessly in any environment.

### Installing Docker Engine
To work with Docker containers, you'll need to have Docker Engine installed on your machine. Docker Engine is available for a variety of Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows. Follow these steps to get Docker installed:

1. **Visit the Official Docker Installation Guide**:
   - Go to [Docker's official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
   - Select the appropriate installation instructions for your operating system.

2. **Download and Install Docker**:
   - Follow the detailed instructions provided on the Docker website to download and install Docker Engine.
   - The installation process varies depending on your operating system, so make sure to follow the steps that correspond to your OS.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Once installed, open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and running:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```
   - This command should return the version of Docker installed on your machine.

4. **Post-Installation Steps**:
   - Depending on your operating system, there might be additional post-installation steps to configure Docker to run without requiring `sudo` (for Linux) or to enable certain features (like Kubernetes on Docker Desktop for Mac/Windows).
   - Follow the post-installation instructions in the Docker documentation for your specific OS.

### Running Docker Containers
With Docker installed, you can now run containers based on Docker images. Containers are isolated environments where your application can run. 

- To test your Docker setup, you can run a simple "Hello World" container:
  ```bash
  docker run hello-world
  ```
- This command downloads a test image if it's not already present, and runs a container from that image. It should print a "Hello from Docker!" message, confirming that Docker is working correctly on your machine.

### Using Docker Compose
For our project, we'll also be using Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications:

- **Install Docker Compose**: Usually, Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows. For Linux, you may need to install it separately. Check the [Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Using `docker-compose.yml`**: Our project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root, which defines our multi-container setup. You can start all defined services with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

### Conclusion
Docker is a powerful tool that helps in ensuring our application runs consistently across all environments. If you encounter any issues with Docker, refer to the official Docker documentation or reach out to the team for assistance.
