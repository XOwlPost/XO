Providing clear workflow tips, especially regarding our choice of Git rebase for maintaining a clean version history, is added to our project's documentation. 

### Workflow Tips: Using Git Rebase

**Why Choose Git Rebase:**
1. **Cleaner History**: Rebase creates a linear and more readable history by moving the entire feature branch to sit on top of the main branch. This avoids the merge commits that are created when using `git merge`.
2. **Simplification of Code Review**: A linear history makes it easier to review changes in a feature branch since you can see exactly what changes were made in the context of the most recent commit on the main branch.
3. **Ease of Upstream Integration**: Regularly rebasing feature branches onto the main branch ensures that you're always working with the most up-to-date code, reducing the chances of complex merge conflicts.

**How to Handle Rebase Workflow:**
1. **Stay Updated**: Regularly update your local main branch with the latest changes from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Start New Feature Branch**:
   - Create and switch to a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/my-feature
     ```

3. **Make Changes and Commit**:
   - Make your changes in this branch and commit them:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add my feature"
     ```

4. **Rebase onto Main Branch**:
   - Before pushing your changes or creating a pull request, rebase your branch onto the updated main branch:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/main
     ```
   - If you encounter conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase process.

5. **Push Changes**:
   - If you haven't pushed your branch yet, simply use:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/my-feature
     ```
   - If you've already pushed your branch and then rebased, you'll need to force push:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/my-feature --force
     ```
   - Note: Use force push cautiously, especially in a shared branch, as it can overwrite changes made by others.

6. **Creating Pull Requests**:
   - Create a pull request for your branch against the main branch. The pull request should only show your commits on top of the current main branch.

7. **Handling Long-Running Feature Branches**:
   - For branches that will be active over a longer period, regularly rebase them onto the main branch to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest changes.

**Best Practices**:
- **Communicate with Your Team**: When using force push, make sure to communicate with your team, as it can impact others working on the same branch.
- **Backup Branches**: Before a complex rebase, it's a good practice to create a backup of your branch.
- **Use Rebase Responsibly**: Avoid rebasing branches that are public and used by other team members unless you have coordinated with them.
- **Test After Rebasing**: Always thoroughly test your changes after a rebase to ensure that the integration of new changes from the main branch hasn't broken anything.

By following these guidelines, our team can effectively use Git rebase to maintain a clean, linear project history, making it easier to track changes and manage contributions. Remember, rebasing is a powerful tool, but it requires careful handling to avoid potential pitfalls, especially in a collaborative environment.
