   - NPM or Yarn: Depending on which package manager your project uses, ensure that users have it installed. NPM is typically bundled with Node.js, while Yarn may require separate installation.

4. **Programming Language Runtimes** (if applicable):
   - If your project or any submodule is written in a specific programming language (like Python, Java, etc.), specify the required version of that language's runtime.

5. **IDE/Text Editor**:
   - While not strictly a prerequisite, recommending an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor that works well with your project (such as Visual Studio Code, JetBrains WebStorm, etc.) can be helpful, especially for new developers.

6. **Environment Setup**:
   - Mention any environment-specific setup that is required, like setting up environment variables, configuring `.env` files, etc.

7. **Database Tools** (if your project involves databases):

## Workflow Tips and Best Practices

Additional tips and best practices for working within this project structure.

Providing clear workflow tips, especially regarding our choice of Git rebase for maintaining a clean version history, is described in our project's documentation. Here's the guide for our team on using Git rebase effectively:

### Workflow Tips: Using Git Rebase

**Why Choose Git Rebase:**
1. **Cleaner History**: Rebase creates a linear and more readable history by moving the entire feature branch to sit on top of the main branch. This avoids the merge commits that are created when using `git merge`.
2. **Simplification of Code Review**: A linear history makes it easier to review changes in a feature branch since you can see exactly what changes were made in the context of the most recent commit on the main branch.
3. **Ease of Upstream Integration**: Regularly rebasing feature branches onto the main branch ensures that you're always working with the most up-to-date code, reducing the chances of complex merge conflicts.

**How to Handle Rebase Workflow:**
1. **Stay Updated**: Regularly update your local main branch with the latest changes from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Start New Feature Branch**:
   - Create and switch to a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/my-feature
     ```

3. **Make Changes and Commit**:
   - Make your changes in this branch and commit them:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add my feature"
     ```

4. **Rebase onto Main Branch**:
   - Before pushing your changes or creating a pull request, rebase your branch onto the updated main branch:
     ```bash
     git fetch origin
     git rebase origin/main
     ```
   - If you encounter conflicts, resolve them and continue the rebase process.

5. **Push Changes**:
   - If you haven't pushed your branch yet, simply use:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/my-feature
     ```
   - If you've already pushed your branch and then rebased, you'll need to force push:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature/my-feature --force
     ```
   - Note: Use force push cautiously, especially in a shared branch, as it can overwrite changes made by others.

6. **Creating Pull Requests**:
   - Create a pull request for your branch against the main branch. The pull request should only show your commits on top of the current main branch.

7. **Handling Long-Running Feature Branches**:
   - For branches that will be active over a longer period, regularly rebase them onto the main branch to ensure they stay up-to-date with the latest changes.

**Best Practices**:
- **Communicate with Your Team**: When using force push, make sure to communicate with your team, as it can impact others working on the same branch.
- **Backup Branches**: Before a complex rebase, it's a good practice to create a backup of your branch.
- **Use Rebase Responsibly**: Avoid rebasing branches that are public and used by other team members unless you have coordinated with them.
- **Test After Rebasing**: Always thoroughly test your changes after a rebase to ensure that the integration of new changes from the main branch hasn't broken anything.

By following these guidelines, our team can effectively use Git rebase to maintain a clean, linear project history, making it easier to track changes and manage contributions. Remember, rebasing is a powerful tool, but it requires careful handling to avoid potential pitfalls, especially in a collaborative environment.

### Expanding the Documentation:

- **Customization**: Tailor the `README.md` to fit the specifics of our project. Include any unique steps or considerations relevant to our workflow.
- **Clarity and Detail**: Aim for clarity and comprehensiveness. The goal is to make it easy for someone new to the project to understand how to get started and work effectively within the project's structure.

Documenting our project in this way not only helps new team members get up to speed quickly but also serves as a valuable reference for the entire team.
