## Git Setup

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that's integral to our project. It helps in tracking changes in source code during software development, supporting collaboration among developers.

### Installing Git
To work with our project, you'll need to have Git installed on your machine. Git allows you to clone the repository, manage branches, and handle submodules.

1. **Download Git**:
   - Visit the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download Git for your operating system.

2. **Install Git**:
   - Follow the instructions provided for your specific OS. Installation is generally straightforward.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run `git --version` to verify that Git is installed correctly. This command should return the installed version of Git.

### Basic Git Operations
Our project uses Git for version control, and it's important to be familiar with basic Git operations:

1. **Cloning the Repository**:
   - To start working on the project, youâ€™ll need to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/XOwlPost/XO
     ```

2. **Working with Branches**:
   - Understand how to create, switch, and merge branches:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b <new-branch>  # Create and switch to a new branch
     git checkout <branch-name>    # Switch to an existing branch
     git merge <branch-name>       # Merge a branch into your current branch
     ```

3. **Managing Submodules**:
   - Our project uses Git submodules, which are versions of other repositories embedded within the main repository.
   - To initialize and update submodules, use:
     ```bash
     git submodule init           # Initialize submodules
     git submodule update         # Update submodules
     ```

4. **Making Commits**:
   - Track your changes with commits:
     ```bash
     git add <file-name>      # Stage changes for commit
     git commit -m "Commit message"  # Commit your changes
     ```

5. **Pushing Changes**:
   - Push your commits to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

### Advanced Git: Using Rebase
We prefer using `git rebase` over `git merge` for a cleaner project history. Please refer to the [Workflow Tips](#workflow-tips-using-git-rebase) section for detailed guidance on our rebase workflow.

### Conclusion
Git is crucial for our project's version control and collaboration. If you're new to Git, many online resources are available to learn more about its functionalities. For any Git-related issues or questions, feel free to reach out to the team.

Customizing this section to suit the specific needs and practices of our project, especially the emphasis on using `git rebase`, will help ensure that all team members are aligned in their use of Git for version control.
