Security Policies and Procedures, please follow the steps to create a SECURITY.md and crafting the content 

---

### Steps to Create a SECURITY.md File

1. **Create the File**:
   - In the root directory of your project, create a file named `SECURITY.md`.

2. **Define Security Policies and Procedures**:
   - The file should clearly articulate your project's security policies and procedures. This includes:

     - **Supported Versions**: Clearly list the versions of your project that are currently supported with security updates.
     - **Vulnerability Reporting**: Offer detailed instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities, including preferred contact methods (such as an email address).
     - **Disclosure Policy**: Describe how you will handle vulnerability reports, including acknowledgment of the report, the evaluation process, and timelines for responses.

3. **Write the Content**:
   - Draft the information in a clear and concise format. Here is a tailored template for your `SECURITY.md`:

     ```markdown
     # Security Policy for the XO Project

     ## Supported Versions

     This section informs users about which versions of the XO project are currently receiving security updates.

     | Version | Supported          |
     | ------- | ------------------ |
     | 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
     | 1.x.x   | :x:                |
     | < 1.0   | :x:                |

     ## Reporting a Vulnerability

     If you discover a security vulnerability in the XO project, please report it by following these steps:

     - Email the vulnerability details to [security@xo.com].
     - Provide a thorough description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it, and any other pertinent information.
     - Expect an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours of submission.

     ## Disclosure Policy

     When a vulnerability is reported:

     - We will confirm receipt of your report.
     - Our team will assess the vulnerability and aim to communicate a timeframe for a resolution within 72 hours.
     - All reports are treated with confidentiality, and we are committed to resolving security issues promptly and thoroughly.
     ```

4. **Commit and Push**:
   - After creating and reviewing your `SECURITY.md`, commit it to your repository and push the changes.
   - This makes the security policy publicly accessible and easily found by users or contributors.

5. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep the `SECURITY.md` file up to date, particularly when new versions are released or if there are changes in security procedures.

This structure ensures that your `SECURITY.md` file is comprehensive and clearly communicates how security issues are handled in your project, thereby building trust with users and contributors.
